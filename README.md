Using this API - https://api.github.com/users,  we would like you to use HTML, CSS and Javascript to read the API and display it in an organised way (include several fields of your choice including the avatar).  In addition, you should add in some sort of sorting mechanism to the front-end, based on user ID, and also filtering, based on type (user or organization).   Style it nicely and make responsive.  You can use any library you like (angular, backbone, react, etc).
